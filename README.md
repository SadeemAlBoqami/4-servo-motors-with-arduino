# 4-servo-motors-with-arduino
## Synchronized control of four servo motors using an Arduino board in Tinkercad.

In this project, four servo motors were programmed to perform a two-second “Sweep” synchronized motion. The motors all start with a gradual movement from 0 to 180 degrees and back to 0, repeating this cycle over a two-second period of time.
After the time limit expired, all motors were automatically set to stabilize at 90 degrees, maintaining this position without any further movement. The goal of the project is to test the synchronization of motion between multiple servo motors, and to control start and stop times using Arduino time functions.
